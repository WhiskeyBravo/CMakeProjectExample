## About

Example on how I usually set up a medium sized [CMake](http://cmake.org) project. It contains a few internal libraries, executables and tests that demonstrate how the custom macros are used. [Google Test](https://code.google.com/p/googletest/) is fetched and built automatically together with the project. [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) and [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) are used as examples for external libraries. The focus is on CMake and not on C++.

It has been tested on:

- Mac OS X 10.9.4

## Rationale

### Folder structure inside the `library` directory

The custom CMake script in `cmake/targets/foo_add_library.cmake` enforces the following folder structure for a library:

    library_name
    |--> include
    |    `--> project_namespace
    |         `--> library_name
    |              |--> header_file_a
    |              |--> header_file_b
    |              `--> header_file_c
    `--> src
         |--> source_file_a
         |--> source_file_b
         `--> source_file_c

This forces other files to include the headers by their full paths mentioning the library name:

    #include <project_namespace/library_name/header_file>

Internally `foo_add_library` uses `target_include_directories` and `target_link_libraries` for each library. This has the advantage that you will get compile errors (missing includes) instead of linking errors if you forget to link against one of the internal libraries.

For executables and tests only the current directory is included. If there is a need for a more complicated folder structure it is probably better to add the files to one of the libraries or create a new one.

### External libraries

An [`INTERFACE` library](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#interface-libraries) is created for each external library. This makes it possible to add them to an internal target with only one command

    target_link_libraries(...)

instead of the common

    include_directories(...)
    add_definitions(...)
    target_link_libraries(...)
